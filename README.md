Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements:
Artemis Financial is a consulting company specializing in individualized financial plans.
They aim to modernize their operations and seek to use the most current and effective software security for their web application.
They want to add a file verification step using checksums to ensure secure data transfer and protect client financial information.
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I conducted a comprehensive manual code review to identify vulnerabilities.
Secure coding is essential to prevent security breaches, data leaks, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Software security enhances customer trust, avoids regulatory fines, protects brand reputation, and ensures business continuity.
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The challenging part was identifying and addressing all potential vulnerabilities.
The Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram was helpful in systematically guiding the assessment.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I implemented encryption algorithms for data protection.
To assess vulnerabilities, I used manual code review and tools like OWASP Dependency-Check Maven.
Mitigation techniques were decided based on industry best practices and specific vulnerabilities found.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? 
After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I conducted functional and static testing after refactoring.
OWASP Dependency-Check Maven was used to detect any new vulnerabilities introduced during refactoring.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Manual code review skills, OWASP Dependency-Check Maven, secure coding practices.
Encryption algorithms, secure communication protocols (HTTPS), industry-standard security guidelines.
What might you show future employers from this assignment?
A comprehensive understanding of secure coding practices.
Skills in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
Experience in implementing encryption, secure communication, and static testing.
This assignment showcases my ability to assess software security, apply encryption and secure communication protocols, and follow industry-standard best practices to enhance software security.
